			Hi! I'm Robert, a security software engineer based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, with experience
			building, breaking, and locking down complex systems that produce millions of dollars in
			revenue. While I am a software/devops engineer first, my background in security helps me keep
			a proactive mind when developing and find flaws well before they hit production.

			I love seeing new ideas come to life and knowing that attackers will have a hard time bringing
			them down. I also have an itch to build things and iterate on ideas. Staying on my toes,
			keeping up with new trends in security and development, and integrating new tools into my
			workflow - including, as of late, GenAI tools - help me solve real problems better and faster
			than the week before.

			My hunger to build has also helped turn some heads - most recently, my team and I won Best MCP
			Agent and Best Async/Ambient Agent at the AI Tinkerers Ottawa hackathon with FastCTX, a
			visualizer to help developers understand what's really going on in their codebase. I built the
			backend of a prototype using tech I had hardly seen before: MCP servers, graph databases, and
			LangChain. Teams I worked with also took home prizes at SpurHacks 2025, cuHacking 2025, and
			uOttaHack 7.

		Professionally, I've also built data pipelines for threat intelligence companies, overhauled
		penetration testing management tools, and helped patch security flaws in software helping
		enterprise clients around the world. Building secure software is a process that requires
		proactive thinking, communication, and a willingness to learn - all of which I like to think I
		develop through martial arts, improv, and attending weekly hacker meetups.

		I'm currently open to opportunities in security and software engineering! If you want a
		security-minded software/devops engineer who can use and build AI tools to staggering effect,
