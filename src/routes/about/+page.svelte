	<h1>Building Digital Fortresses</h1>
	<p>
		I have been writing code since I was 13 years old, and securing it since 2020. With a security
		mindset and a proven track record of learning things on the fly, I can help lock down your
		codebase, automation systems, and infrastructure.
	</p>
	<h1>Flexibility, Creativity, Courage, and Innovation</h1>
	<p>
		I've spent years making projects with all manner of technologies, specializing in web and cloud.
		These range from a structlog integration with FastAPI to a SaaS app in Rails and Next.js that
		helps students gamify their academic goals. My team and I even built a container runtime for QNX
		when the platform didn't even support them back at cuHacking 2025 - despite everything seemingly
		telling us it couldn't be done.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you need your projects to have the same stale life, unfortunately, I can't help you there.
		That said, I can help breathe new life into anything I work on.
