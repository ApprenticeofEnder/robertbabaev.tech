		Hey, I'm Robert! Thanks for stopping by. <strong

	</p>
	<p>
		I'm your guy. Since 2019 I've been involved with cybersecurity, and I like breaking websites
		wide open, but I <strong>love</strong> locking them down from attack. Even this portfolio website
		has a few nifty security tricks up its sleeve despite the small attack surface. (Try bypassing Cloudflare,
		and if you laugh feel free to buy me a coffee.)
	</p>
	<p>
		I've done everything from pitch a cybersecurity business while having no idea what I was doing
		and still getting into an accelerator, to flying to Europe and <Link href="https://ecsc.eu/icc/"
			>fighting side by side with and going toe to toe against some of the best university-level
			hackers on the planet</Link
		>. Am I the best penetration tester or security developer on Earth? Not by a long shot. But I
		love educating folks looking to get into the field through presentations at my university, and
		advocating for better security in both conversation and research.
