	<p>
		Hi, my name is Robert, and I'm a fourth year standing student in a Bachelor of Computer Science
		at Carleton University. Currently, my focus is in cyber security, which I've been involved in
		for a few years. I like to think of myself as striking a balance between security and
		development, where I build tooling and practice secure development in the web apps I build to
		the best of my ability. In other words, I like being either on the purple team or just doing
		security development work.
	</p>
	<p>
		I started my cybersecurity journey in 2019 with, of all things, a business pitch. The idea? Hack
		hackers back. Automatically. An idea riddled with flaws, but I was able to convince the judges
		of the idea enough that they accepted me into the Hatch 2019 Cohort. It was there that I
		actually began to study the field in more depth, and realized that in no way was this idea
		getting off the ground. But that led me to attending a cybersecurity workshop, which got me into
		Capture the Flag games, and that encouraged me to practice further.
	</p>
	<p>
		Between June 2021 and June 2022, I tried my hand at competitive Capture the Flag events, with
		CyberSci Team Canada. I got the opportunity to travel to both Prague, Czechia and Athens, Greece
		to compete in international CTFs. They were excellent opportunities, which I'm really thankful
		to CyberSci for, and I was able to see some of Europe for the first time and meet awesome
		people.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also had the opportunity to act as the president of the Carleton Cyber Security Club for a
		while, leading workshops and sparking interest in the field. I love making an impact in
		cybersecurity, whether it's getting someone to join their first CTF, or convincing them to
		switch to using a password manager. Also, you should really use a password manager these days.
	</p>
	<p>
		Outside of work, I enjoy doing Muay Thai, playing tabletop RPGs such as Lancer, writing third
		party RPG supplements and open source software, and spending time with my girlfriend (often on
		the Minecraft server I host).
